# Whole → Part Cognitive Ordering

## Governance Role
constraint

## Principle

The system assumes **whole → part cognition**.

The global structure must stabilize before safe detail refinement can occur.

Creativity may assist in forming the provisional whole, but detailed operations are unsafe until structural coherence is achieved.

## Implications

- Detail work cannot be treated as authoritative if the whole is unstable.
- Recursion must anchor to global structure.
- Premature detail elaboration increases instability.
- Creative processes may run before full structure exists, but must aim to form a coherent whole.

This ordering is a design invariant.
