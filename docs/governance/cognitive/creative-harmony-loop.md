# Creative Harmony Loop

## Governance Role
constraint

## Definition

The Creative Harmony Loop is a bounded structural repair mechanism.

It is not exploratory creativity — it is used to restore coherence when structure is unstable.

## Loop Phases

1. Sense Disharmony  
2. Invoke Creative Loop (bounded, non-decisive)  
3. Restore Harmony  
4. Return to Structure  
5. Proceed to Detail

## Stop Condition

The loop terminates when structural harmony is restored.

The stop condition is not time, tokens, or iteration count.

## Constraint

Creativity must return control to structural constraint after restoration.

Creativity cannot be the governing mode.
